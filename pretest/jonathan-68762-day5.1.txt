1. onPause()  is called when the activity is paused,  which means 
it is no longer visible to the user but 
it is still running in the background.
onStop() will close the activity and will not consume the cpu

2.to pass data using intent  we use putExtra() method of intent class

3. onSaveInstanceState() when handling screen rotations , the system 
calls onSaveInstanceState() to save the current state of the activity so 
when the screen rotate the activity can restore its state 
from the saved state.

4.onPause -> onStop -> onDestroy

5. Use startActivityForResult() to launch the new activity.
In the new activity, set the result using setResult() and finish the activity.
Handle the result in onActivityResult() in the original activity.


1.
val intent = Intent(this, MainActivity::class.java)
startActivity(intent)

the code is work but it will not save the value to parse data

2.
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) 
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
}

3. override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
}
